            <h1>About Robert</h1>
            <p>I am currently attending Western Washington University for my Masters degree in Computer Science. My favorite classes have been Web and Mobile app development. I grew up in West Seattle and moved to Bellingham for school. I choose Western Washington University because of the atmosphere and after one computer science course, I was hooked. I finished my major and graduated in 2018, but went back to school to learn more. I've recently been working on several projects, all of which I will add to this website under the portfolio page. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In the next five years, I would like to start my career in Web development, move to a different, preferably warmer, location, and travel to Japan.
            </p>

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>During Graduate School, I was a TA for the computer science department at Western Washington University. I gained a lot experience testing and debugging student's code, as well as explaining my ideas in many different ways. </p>
            <p>While I have been in school, I have worked mostly at Walmart. I started on CAP 2 and moved to Support Manager then back to CAP 2 as the CAP 2 Supervisor. I was able to practice working in a team and working as a team leader, until I eventually decided to focus on school.</p>
