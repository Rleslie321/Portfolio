This website shows my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. Javascript libraries include Baguettebox, Owl.Carousel, JQuery, underscore, and more. It contains an about me section, it pulls all of my projects from Github using their rest API, my resume, two different methods for displaying photos, a contact page that stores all messages in a MySQL database, and a message page that displays all of those messages from the database.
