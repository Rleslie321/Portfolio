Website designed with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript to create a shopping list that is organized by whatever categories you would like. You can choose to do by aisle or by section of the store. You can add items to each category along with the amount you need to buy and the price that will cost and it will have a total at the bottom of the page. The list is editable or can be deleted.
